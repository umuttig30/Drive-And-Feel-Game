Drive and feel is an simulator game, where player can hear, and feel how fast the car accelerates, sounds, looks etc.
I'm still working on the game, so it is not fully done yet, so there can be bugs. And there is also coming more features, like automatic gearbox, zooming in/out to make player feel more the acceleration, a menu with its own textures for this game and much more!

instructions: Gas (W), shift up(Space), shift down(delete)
